# About me

I graduated from Yale in 2006 with a B.A. in Computer Science and
Psychology. As an undergraduate I performed research in human-robot
interaction, working with
[Brian Scassellati](http://www.cs.yale.edu/~scaz/), and unsupervised
language learning, with
[Charles Yang](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ycharles/). I also spent a
tremendous amount of time working on the shows and serving on the
board of the [The Yale Dramat](http://www.dramat.org/).

Between college and graduate school, I worked for the Microsoft Auto
team on speech recognition and text-to-speech in cars, specifically on
[Ford Sync](http://www.ford.com/technology/sync/) and
[Kia UVO](https://www.myuvo.com/). I also worked with the
[Microsoft Research Speech Technology Group](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/srg/default.aspx)
on
[CommuteUX](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/CommuteUX/).

I did my doctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania, working with
[Mitch Marcus](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mitch/) and [Charles
Yang](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ycharles/). My thesis work combined
insights from unsupervised learning, language acquisition, and
psycholinguistics to build models of how we learn and process words. I
then applied some of the insights from this work as post-doctoral
fellow at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, developing models
of how language is processed in the brain and applying it to autism
research.

I continue to build language technology with a focus on how we can
build effective and efficient systems by using insights from how
humans learn, represent, and process language.
