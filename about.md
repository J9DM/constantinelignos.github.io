# About me

I graduated from Yale in 2006 with a B.A. in Computer Science and
Psychology. As an undergraduate I performed research in human-robot
interaction, working with
[Brian Scassellati](http://www.cs.yale.edu/~scaz/), and unsupervised
language learning, with
[Charles Yang](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ycharles/). I also spent a
tremendous amount of time working on the shows and serving on the
board of the [The Yale Dramat](http://www.dramat.org/).

Between college and graduate school, I worked for the Microsoft Auto
team on speech recognition and text-to-speech in cars, specifically on
[Ford Sync](http://www.ford.com/technology/sync/) and
[Kia UVO](https://www.myuvo.com/). I also worked with the
[Microsoft Research Speech Technology Group](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/srg/default.aspx)
on
[CommuteUX](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/CommuteUX/).

I am committed to applying language technology to projects that
benefit humankind. From September 2013 to May 2015, I worked at The
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia as a post-doctoral fellow,
developing models of how language is processed in the brain and
applying it to autism research.
