title: Blends research featured in TIME Magazine
---

My work with [Hilary Prichard](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~hilaryp/) on word blends is featured in the July 2015 TIME Answers issue:
[Why Did 'Frenemy' Stick? Academics are unraveling the mystery behind the success--and failure--of blended words](http://time.com/3935283/why-did-frenemy-stick/). While that article is only available to subscribers, you can read more about our work here: [Quantifying cronuts: Predicting the quality of blends](/blends).
